Currently Working On
Arxspace

Arxspace is a personal productivity and planning web application I’m building to help people structure their routines, track progress, and stay focused on long-term goals.
The idea is to combine daily planning, habit tracking, and self-improvement systems into one simple workspace instead of juggling multiple apps.

The project is focused on:

Designing a clear and minimal user experience

Building scalable features step by step instead of rushing

Using modern web technologies with a long-term goal of turning it into a real product, not a demo

Currently Learning

I’m actively learning computer science fundamentals with a strong focus on understanding logic and problem-solving, not just syntax.

Main areas of focus:

Python programming and core programming concepts

Data analysis and working with real data

Artificial intelligence and automation fundamentals

Writing cleaner, more maintainable code

I usually learn by building small projects, breaking things, and fixing them until the logic actually makes sense.
