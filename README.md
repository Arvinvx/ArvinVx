## Current Project - Arxspace
Arxspace is a personal productivity and planning web application focused on routines, focus, and long-term self-improvement.  
The goal is to combine planning, habit tracking, and progress tracking into one structured workspace instead of using multiple tools.

The project is built gradually with an emphasis on clarity, usability, and long-term scalability.

## Notable Projects
- **Arxspace** – A productivity and planning system for routines, habits, and goal tracking
- **Workout & Progress Tracker** – A personal system for tracking training, body measurements, and consistency
- **Python Practice Projects** – Small programs focused on logic, data handling, and problem solving
- **AI & Automation Experiments** – Early-stage experiments with automation and AI concepts

## Areas of Focus
- Computer science fundamentals
- Programming logic and problem solving
- Data analysis with Python
- Artificial intelligence and automation basics
- Building real projects instead of tutorial clones

## Technologies I Use / Learn
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- Git & GitHub
- Basic data analysis tools
- Web application fundamentals

## How I Work
I learn by building small projects, breaking things, reading documentation, and refining my code over time.  
Understanding why something works matters more to me than copying solutions.
