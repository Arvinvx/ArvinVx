## 🚀 Current Project — **Arxspace**

🔗 [https://www.ar4x.store/](https://www.ar4x.store/)

**Arxspace** is a personal productivity and planning web app I’m building to stop my life (and brain) from being scattered across 12 different tools.
It’s a **single workspace** for:

* 🗓️ Daily planning
* 📈 Progress tracking
* 🔁 Habit systems
* 🎯 Long-term focus & self-improvement

Basically: one dashboard instead of chaos.

## 📚 Learning

I’m actively improving in these areas:

* 🐍 **Python**
* 📊 **Data Analysis with Pandas**
  Cleaning data, extracting insights, understanding how data flows.
* 🤖 **Machine Learning**
  Supervised & unsupervised learning, model evaluation, ML libraries.
* 📐 **Mathematics for Machine Learning**
  Linear algebra, statistics, probability (the fun pain).
* 🎮 **C#**
  Syntax, ecosystem, and small projects for real understanding.

## 🧠 What I Already Know

* 🌐 **HTML & CSS**
  Page structure, layouts, and how frontend pieces fit together.
* 🐍 **Python**
  Small to medium scripts, problem-solving, general-purpose use.
* 🎯 **C# (Basic)**
  Core concepts and syntax, still grinding.

How I learn without losing my mind:

* 🧪 **W3Schools** — Coding, ML basics
