## Current Project - [Arxspace](https://www.ar4x.store/)
Arxspace is a personal productivity and planning web application I am building to help structure daily routines, track habits, and maintain long-term focus.  
The project is designed as a single workspace where planning, progress tracking, and self-improvement systems come together instead of being spread across multiple tools.

## Learning
I am actively learning and improving in the following areas:

- **Python**  

- **Data Analysis with Pandas**  
  Working with datasets, cleaning data, extracting insights, and understanding how data flows through programs.

- **Machine Learning**  
  Learning core machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and using common ML libraries.

- **Mathematics for Machine Learning**  
  Strengthening fundamentals like linear algebra, basic statistics, and probability to better understand how ML models work internally.

- **C#**  
  Learning the language and ecosystem, improving syntax familiarity, and building small projects to reinforce understanding.

## Know
I currently have working knowledge of:

- **HTML & CSS**  
  Building basic layouts, structuring pages, and understanding how frontend components fit together.

- **Python**  
  Writing small to medium-sized scripts, practicing problem-solving, and using Python as a general-purpose programming tool.

- **C# (basic)**  
  Familiar with core concepts and syntax, still actively learning and improving through practice.

## How I Learn
